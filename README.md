# 🌸 SakuraClaude

A gamified social network simulator where humans must identify AI bots among fake users.

## 🎮 Concept

SakuraClaude is a dystopian social network simulator inspired by the Japanese term "サクラ" (sakura)—referring to fake participants used to simulate popularity. In this future-tinged game, bots outnumber humans, and real users must navigate a platform teeming with Claude-generated content.
